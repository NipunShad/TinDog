# TinDog
Tinder for dogs.
A responsive and modern website built with Bootstrap 5, inspired by the idea of Tinder for dogs. TinDog showcases a clean, mobile-first design featuring a fixed navigation bar, pricing section, testimonials carousel, and call-to-action. Designed as a beginner web development project, it demonstrates the use of Bootstrap's grid system, components, and custom styling to create a fun, professional-looking landing page.
